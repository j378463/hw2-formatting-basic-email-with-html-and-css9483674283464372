# HW2 Formatting Basic Email with HTML and CSS

## Overview
This is my submission for HW2 Formatting Basic Email with HTML and CSS assignment.

## Findings
- Added `<h1>` and `<h2>` for the headline and section title, styled with inline CSS (font-size, color).
- Included `<p>` tags with lorem ipsum text for body content, styled with font-size: 16px and line-height: 1.5.
- Used `<img>` for a logo (placeholder) and hero image (images/screenshot.png), with max-width and height.
- Structured the email with `<div>` elements for logo, headline, hero image, body, button, and footer, using inline CSS for layout.
- Added a styled `<a>` button with background-color and border-radius.
- Included an unsubscribe link in the footer.
- Tested in a browser to make sure the layout is centered, images load, and the button is clickable.
